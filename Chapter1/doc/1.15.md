```Scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
   (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

### 1. How many times is the procedure `p` applied when `(sine 12.15)` is evaluated?

5 times.
```
(sine 12.15)
(p (sine 4.05))
(p (p (sine 1.3499999999999999)))
(p (p (p (sine 0.44999999999999996))))
(p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.049999999999999996))))))
```
### 2. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of $a$) used by the process generated by the `sine` procedure when `(sine a)` is evaluated?

## Growth in space
The `sine` procedure divides `a` by `3` until the result reaches the value below `0.1`. And for each call of the `sine` procedure, `p` procedure is called. Hence, the space required grows.

Let `n` the times the `sine` procedure is called, this can be represented:
$$
\frac{a}{3^n}<=0.1
$$
And if you solve this:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{a}{3^n}\le&0.1\\
3^n\ge&10a\\
n\ge&\log_3(10a)
\end{align}
$$
Therefore, the growth in space is $\Theta(\log a)$
## Growth in number of steps
As I stated in the explanation of the growth in space, for each call of the `sine` procedure, `p` procedure is called. Thus, the number of steps is proportional to the growth in space.
Therefore, the growth in number of steps is $\Theta(\log a)$
