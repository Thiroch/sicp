Newton's method for cube roots:
$$
y_{(n+1)}=\frac{\frac{x}{y_n2}+2y_n}{3}
$$
I need to use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root procedure.  
From [Exercise 1.07](1.07.md), copy the `improved-sqrt` procedure and change `improve` to match the formula above.

Change `improve` from this
```scheme
(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))
```
to this
```scheme
(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+ (/ x (square guess)) (* 2 guess) ) 3))
```
and it should work.
