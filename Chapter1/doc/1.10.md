## Q2. Give concise mathematical definitions
### `(define (f n) (A 0 n))`
#### Mathematical definition
$$f{(n)}=2n$$
#### Reasoning
When $x=0$, `(A x y)` returns `(* 2 y)`.

### `(define (g n) (A 1 n))`
#### Mathematical definition
$$g{(n)}=2^n$$
#### Reasoning
* When $x = 0$, `(A x y)` returns `(* 2 y)`.
* When $y=1$, `(A x y)` returns $2$.
* When $x=1$ and $y>1$, `(A x y)` returns `(A 0 (A 1 (n-1)))`.

Therefore, `(A 1 n)` is reduced to `(* 2 (A 1 (n-1))))`.  
Mathematically, this equals $g(n)=2\times g(n-1)$.
Which is, $g(n)=2^n$
### `(define (h n) (A 2 n))`
#### Mathematical definition
$$h(n) = 2^{h(n-1)}$$
#### Reasoning
* When $x = 0$, `(A x y)` returns `(* 2 y)`.
* When $y=1$, `(A x y)` returns $2$.
* When $x=1$ and $y>1$, `(A x y)` returns `(A 0 (A 1 (n-1)))`.
* When $x = 2$ and $y>1$, `(A x y)` returns `(A 1 (A 2 (n-1)))`.

From the fourth bullet point, `(A 2 n)` is `(A 1 (A 2 (n-1)))`.  
Since we already established `(A 1 n)` is $2^n$, you can write this pseudo equation:

$$
(\text{A 2 n}) = 2^{(\text{A 2 (n-1)})}
$$

And if you substitute `(A 2 n)` with `h(n)`, you get

$$h(n) = 2^{h(n-1)}$$
