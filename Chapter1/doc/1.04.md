```
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

* If $b$ is greater than $0$ (which means $b$ is positive), the result is $(a + b)$.
* If $b$ is equal to or less than $0$ (which means $b$ is $0$ or negative), the result is $(a - b)$.
So this procedure returns the result of $a + \lvert b \rvert$.
